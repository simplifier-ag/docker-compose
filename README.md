# Simplifier docker-compose template
This repository contains a docker compose setup to run [Simplifier](https://simplifier.io)

The setup files are organized in branches. Each Simplifier Makers Choice (MC) and Long Term Support (LTS) has its own branch. Also, there are generic branches for Long Term Support and Makers Choice editions which always contain the most current versions of the repective editions. It is recommended to use one of these two brances. These are:
 * Makers Choice: https://github.com/simplifier-ag/docker-compose/tree/release/MC
 * Long Term Support: https://github.com/simplifier-ag/docker-compose/tree/release/LTS
